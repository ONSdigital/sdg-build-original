This is one of the more complicated scripts in the suite. It does he following\
 for every csv file:
    1. For each column decide a parent child relationship with every other.
    2. Column A is a parent of column B if:
        a. B is only present when A is present
        b. A is sometimes present when B is not present
        c. If A and B are only seen together then the left-most column in the\
         data frame is the parent
    3. Once edges have been defined they are pruned so that grand parents are\
    not mistaken for parents
